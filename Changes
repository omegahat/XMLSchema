  *    Compute default values for slots of new class from schema elements to handle
       sequences and optional values (i.e. count containing 0).

  *    Compute name for <any/> element as any, not NA.

0.6-1

  *    Support for recognizing types or elements in a schema come from XML schema types themselves,
       e.g. a <schema> element.


0.6-0

  *   Identify direct cross-references in type definitions in schema and avoid circularities
      in generation of R classes.

0.5-0  (Extensive updates and changes.)

  *   Compute namespaces in fromXML() to resolve namespace references.

  *   Added exportClassDefs() which generates R code that will define the classes and coerce methods
      for the classes we defined via defineClass() from the schema.

  *   Defined gYear and gYearMonth.

  *   Defined dateTime, time and date classes.
      Moved SOAPDateTime, etc. to SOAPDateTimeType for representing the type descriptions, not the instances.

  *   Generated functions now do not rely on their environment and so can be more readily serialized.
      The values are inserted into the function either when they are created or when they are serialized.

  *   Coercion functions for restricted types "compile" the computations at function creation time rather than
      performing some of the tests at run-time.

  *   Mechanism to identify types in a different SchemaTypes within a SchemaCollection 
      which have the same names and so would map to the same R name.  We adjust these 
      to have an Rname that maps to a different R class name so that they will be unique.

  *   Improved version of top-level code to read schema so that we collect schema nodes into 
      a SchemaCollection regardless of depth of nesting.

  *   Improved, removed and simplified some special cases in processSchemaType().

  *   The approach still cannot handle definitions that involve cross-references in <choice> nodes
      that are recursive.  See EPO/ops.wsdl 

0.4-0  (Extensive updates and changes.)

  *   Restriction for hexBinary, string, integers and doubles.

  *   Introduced a class CodeGenOpts to provide controls/options for parameterizing the code that generates
      the R classes from the schema types.  Currently, this controls whether we create a prototype
      which is curently only used to initialize string types with "". 

  *   Major change to introduce LocalElements and preserve the information about these Elements
      that enclose content and types.

  *   Base64Encoded string class and coercion methods to coerce to character and raw.

  *   Many changes to the processSchemaType() function and helpers to handle different schema types.

  *   readSchema() has an asNode parameter that controls whether we treat the input 
      as a schema node or go find it in the document by coercing the node to the root node of the
      document as we have done for WSDLs. The default should suffice.

0.3-0

  *   Introduced SOAPGroupType and SOAPGroupRefType for representing groups.
      Currently we don't do "much" with them.

  *   Handle the case where we have a Choice in a sequence.

  *   Support for an extension to a type where the extension is a sequence/list.

  *   Introduction of AnySimpleType to correspond to anySimpleType in the XML schema specification.

  *   Get the element type of a SimpleSequenceType via processSchemaType() rather than just creating a SOAPType locally.

0.2-0
 
  *   Significant work to handle more types.

0.1-6

  *   Handle when the types are defined directly in a WSDL rather than in a schema node.

  *   Compute the elementFormQualified via a generic function which handles different 
      arrangments of the types.

  *   General fixes motivated by the brenda.wsdl document

  *   Simple fixes for omissions in processRestriction() and processExtension()

0.1-2

  *   Added support for elementFormQualified in the schema.

0.1-1

  *   Added methods for fromXML when there is no type and for NULL.
